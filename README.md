# JobLook Android App
JobLook is an Android app developed using React Native, which allows users to search for job listings from multiple sources. The app uses an API from RapidAPI to fetch job listings and display them to the user in an organized and user-friendly way. Tailwind CSS was used to style the app and create a consistent visual language throughout.

## Technical Skills: 
React Native, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, RapidAPI

## Architecture: 
JobLook's architecture consists of several key components, including:

## Navigation: 
The app uses React Navigation to create a navigation structure that allows users to easily switch between screens and search for jobs based on location and keywords.

## API Integration: 
The app integrates with RapidAPI's job search API to fetch job listings based on the user's search criteria. The API data is then parsed and formatted for display within the app.

## Data Management: 
JobLook uses Redux for state management, allowing for efficient data flow throughout the app. The app also uses AsyncStorage to cache job listings for faster loading times.

## Responsibilities:

Designed and implemented the app's navigation structure using React Navigation.
Integrated RapidAPI's job search API and implemented parsing and formatting of the fetched data.
Utilized Tailwind CSS to style the app's components and ensure consistency across screens.
Developed the Redux data management system for efficient state management.
Implemented caching of job listings using AsyncStorage to improve app performance.
Challenges:

One of the main challenges was integrating the RapidAPI job search API, as it required proper handling of API keys and authentication.
Another challenge was designing the app's navigation structure in a way that was intuitive for users and allowed for efficient job searching.
Achievements:

Successfully integrated the RapidAPI job search API and implemented efficient parsing and formatting of the fetched data.
Created an intuitive and user-friendly navigation structure that allowed for efficient job searching and switching between screens.
Developed a visually appealing and consistent app design using Tailwind CSS.
